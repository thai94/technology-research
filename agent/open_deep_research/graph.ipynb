      "Content:\n",
      "Change Data Capture (CDC) is a technique used to track changes made to data in a database or data storage system. The goal of CDC is to identify and capture the changes made to the data, rather than replicating the entire dataset.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this article, we will explore the different methods of implementing CDC, including:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Date Column Differences**: This method involves creating a column that stores the current date and time whenever a row is inserted or updated.\n",
      "2. **Table Diffs**: This method involves comparing snapshots of the table at regular intervals to identify changes.\n",
      "3. **Trigger-Based CDC**: This method involves using database triggers to capture data changes and store them in a separate table.\n",
      "4. **Log-Based CDC**: This method involves parsing the native transaction logs of the source system to identify data changes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Each of these methods has its advantages and disadvantages, which are discussed below:\n",
      "\n",

      "1. **Date Column Differences**: This method involves creating a column that stores the current date and time whenever a row is inserted or updated.\n",
      "2. **Table Diffs**: This method involves comparing snapshots of the table at regular intervals to identify changes.\n",
      "3. **Trigger-Based CDC**: This method involves using database triggers to capture data changes and store them in a separate table.\n",
      "4. **Log-Based CDC**: This method involves parsing the native transaction logs of the source system to identify data changes.\n",

      "1. **Date Column Differences**: This method involves creating a column that stores the current date and time whenever a row is inserted or updated.\n",
      "2. **Table Diffs**: This method involves comparing snapshots of the table at regular intervals to identify changes.\n",
      "3. **Trigger-Based CDC**: This method involves using database triggers to capture data changes and store them in a separate table.\n",
      "4. **Log-Based CDC**: This method involves parsing the native transaction logs of the source system to identify data changes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Each of these methods has its advantages and disadvantages, which are discussed below:\n",
